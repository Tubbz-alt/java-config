1) EnvFileParser chokes on multiline vars
For 2.1:
  - handling virtuals
    http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/java/wiki/Virtuals

For 2.1.8
  - Bug# 259280

For 2.1.9
 [08:16] <Caster> the idea is marking 1.4 VM's as build only so you won't be able to select them as system/user vm
 [08:16] <Caster> which I think should also mean that running 'GENTOO_VM=blackdown-jdk-1.4.2 java' will fail
 [08:17] <ali_bush> oh ok
 [08:17] <Caster> but then java-pkg-*2.eclass should set some override variable that will let this work again, in order to build with them

For 3.0:
  - Make EnvironmentManager's get_packages function return
    a list packages instead of a dictionary. For lookup by name
	we already have the get_package function.
