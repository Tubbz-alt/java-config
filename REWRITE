Goals for the rewrite:
- reduce dependencies (c++ with few external libs)
- provide a dbus interface (for use in Eclipse/Netbeans library managers)
- solve outstanding bugs
  * deep scan for class versioning issues (bug #161622)
  * wrappers for all JVM tools
  * virtuals handling for jdbc providers
  * virtuals provided by JDKs
- remove all deprecated command line options
- don't depend on pm code (custom antlr based parsing)
- unify java-config-wrapper,javatoolkit and java-config to a single package
